## Abstract

Our project aims to explore the relationship between Female same sex couples and Male same sex couples in gayborhood areas. We hope to analyze marraige patterns in certain zip codes and overall, as well as comparison between the % married for Femal versus male and in general wether there are more Female or Male couples in these areas.

## Proposal

Our project delves into the differences in same-sex couples for males and females. Our hope is that this research could be contributed to social science relating to gender differences, societal structures specifically relating to LGBTQ populations.  The questions we pose include:  

1. How do the rates for same sex couples marraige compare between genders?

2. How do overall rates of FF same sex households compare to rates of MM households in gayborhoods?

3. Are there significant differences between marraige practices in certain areas or is there a larger trend between genders or no correlation for either?

Understanding these questions is crucial in analyzing the way our social structure works, gender norms, LGBTQ life and influences and if there are differences this could lead to more research about the possible cause of such differences and if there are underlying issues. Knowing about social trends can tell so much about the development and health of a culture and can lead to better social programs for aiding affected parties.
