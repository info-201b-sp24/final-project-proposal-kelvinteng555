## Abstract

Our project aims to explore the relationship between Female same sex couples and Male same sex couples in gayborhood areas. We hope to analyze marraige patterns in certain zip codes and overall, as well as comparison between the % married for Femal versus male and in general wether there are more Female or Male couples in these areas. 


## Keywords

gay, pride, gayborhood, lesbian, marraige, statistics

## Proposal

Our project delves into the differences in same-sex couples for males and females.  The questions we pose include:  

1. How does sentiment expressed on social media platforms correlate with mental health indicators?

2. Are there discernible trends in sentiment that coincide with fluctuations in mental health metrics?

3. Can interventions based on sentiment analysis positively influence mental health outcomes?

Understanding these questions is crucial in designing strategies to mitigate potential negative impacts of social media on mental well-being and harness its potential for positive change.


Related Work:
Research in this domain has highlighted the complex interplay between social media usage and mental health outcomes. Twenge et al. (2018) [1] observed a significant increase in depressive symptoms among adolescents, coinciding with the rise of smartphones and social media. Similarly, Moreno et al. (2016) [2] emphasized the need for tailored interventions to address mental health issues exacerbated by social media use among college students. Additionally, studies like Fadhil & Gaber (2019) [3] have explored sentiment analysis techniques to gauge emotional states on platforms like Twitter, providing valuable insights into user behavior and mental health discourse.

The Dataset:
We sourced our data from the Twitter API, collecting tweets containing relevant keywords over a specified period. The dataset comprises over 200,000 tweets and includes features such as text content, timestamp, user metadata, and sentiment scores obtained through natural language processing techniques. Ethical considerations involve ensuring user privacy and consent, as well as addressing potential biases in the data collection process. Limitations may include the representativeness of Twitter users and the challenge of accurately inferring mental health states from social media posts.

4. Implications

If our research successfully addresses the research questions, it could have significant implications for various stakeholders. Technologists could develop algorithms and tools to promote healthier online environments, while designers may incorporate features that encourage positive interactions. Policymakers could use insights from our findings to formulate regulations or guidelines aimed at safeguarding mental health in digital spaces.

5. Limitations & Challenges
Challenges associated with our project include the complexity of analyzing sentiment accurately and the need to account for cultural and linguistic nuances in social media discourse. Additionally, interpreting correlations between online sentiment and mental health indicators requires careful consideration of confounding variables and potential biases inherent in the data collection process.
