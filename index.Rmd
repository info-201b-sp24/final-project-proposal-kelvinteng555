### Abstract

Our project aims to explore the relationship between Female same sex couples and Male same sex couples in gayborhood areas. We hope to analyze marraige patterns in certain zip codes and overall, as well as comparison between the % married for Femal versus male and in general wether there are more Female or Male couples in these areas. 


### Keywords

gay, pride, gayborhood, lesbian, marraige, statistics

### Proposal

Our project delves into the differences in same-sex couples for males and females. Our hope is that this research could be contributed to social science relating to gender differences, societal structures specifically relating to LGBTQ populations.  The questions we pose include:  

1. How do the rates for same sex couples marraige compare between genders?

2. What influences the concentration of same-sex relationships in some regions compared to others?

3. Are there significant differences between marraige practices in certain areas or is there a larger trend between genders or no correlation for either?

Understanding these questions is crucial in analyzing the way our social structure works, gender norms, LGBTQ life and influences and if there are differences this could lead to more research about the possible cause of such differences and if there are underlying issues. Understanding pieces of a complex society helps in building adequete structures and understanding / documenting the history happening around the world every day. Knowing about social trends can tell so much about the development and health of a culture and can lead to better social programs for aiding affected parties, but also can just be useful to document and compare over time.

### The Dataset:
Found on The Pudding: 
The-pudding/data/gayborhoods/README.md
The dataset we chose features information about Gay and Lesbian households, their marraige status, zip codes, straight couples in the area, gay bars in the area, ratios of amounts of gay, lesbian, and same-sex couples in general compared to all households and more. 

### Implications:
This data can be used to analyze social patterns in certain areas where marraige may be higher in general, among straight couples, same-sex couples or even specifically gay or lesbian couples. This can also be compared with LGBTQ affiliated businesses in the area to see if that affects any patterns to map social tendancies in gayborhoods.

### Limitations & Challenges:
Although patterns may be able to be formed from this data, the dataset isnt incredibly large so analysis may not be applicable to the greater area. There are also so many factors besides location complicating social patterns such as marraige and clustering of couples of a certain identity that it's difficult to tie a trend to a certain area. There could also be inconsistancies in the data due to lack of registration of married couples and especially non married couples.

 ### Acknowledgements:
We would like to thank our Teaching Assistant, Mie, our Professor, and The-Pudding for making this project possible. 

# Chart 1

For chart 1, we made a bar graph comparing the rate of married same-sex couples between the 5 most populous zipcodes in the dataset.
